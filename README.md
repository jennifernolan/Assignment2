Description of Project
----------------------
Extermination is a simple 2D Unity game implemented using C Sharp. The aim of the game is to shoot as many of the enemies, aka spiders, as possible. The player has a gun that can shoot bullets that cause the spiders to explode. Every spider that is killed adds 10 points to the players score. The player has a health bar that starts at 100% at the beginning of the game. Any time a spider touches the player the players health goes down by 10, this is indicated by the slider in the bottom left corner. The screen flashes slightly with the colour red to show that the player is hurt, this gradually fades out until the player is hurt again. Also the player makes a hurt sound to indicate that a spider has just hurt him. Once the players health reaches 0% the player explodes. Once the player is dead the Game Over screen appears which gives the option to restart the game if the user wishes. Otherwise they can just exit the program.

Instructions for Use
--------------------
* Direction arrows, ```UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT```, to mover the player
* ```LEFT MOUSE CLICK``` to shoot
* ```R``` to restart when prompted
